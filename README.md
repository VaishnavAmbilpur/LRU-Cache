# LRU Cache (C++ Implementation)

A high-performance Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache implementation in C++ using hash map and doubly linked list.

## 🚀 Features

- **O(1) time complexity** for both `get()` and `put()` operations
- **Automatic eviction** of least recently used items when capacity is reached
- **Manual memory management** without relying on STL containers
- **Interactive menu-driven interface** for easy testing
- **Single-file implementation** for portability
